# Doxygen Documentation Generation and Viewing Instructions

This guide provides instructions for generating, extracting, and viewing the Doxygen documentation in HTML and LaTeX formats.

---

## Steps to Generate and View the Documentation:

### 1. **Run the Doxygen Configuration File**:
   - Locate the `Doxyfile` in the project directory.
   - Run Doxygen using the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     doxygen Doxyfile
     ```
   - This will generate two folders in ./docs: 
     - `html` (for HTML documentation)
     - `latex` (for LaTeX documentation)

---

### 2. **View the HTML Documentation**:
   - Navigate to the `html` folder generated by Doxygen.
   - Locate the file named `index.html`.
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser:
     - Double-click the file to open it using the default web browser.
     - Alternatively, right-click the file and select `Open With` to choose a specific browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

#### Recommended Browsers:
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge (latest version)
- Safari (for macOS users)

### 3. **Generate and View LaTeX Documentation**:
   - Navigate to the `latex` folder generated by Doxygen.
   - Compile the LaTeX files into a PDF:
     - Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX.
     - Run the following commands in the terminal:
       ```bash
       cd latex
       make
       ```
     - This will produce a PDF file (e.g., `refman.pdf`) in the `latex` folder.
   - Open the PDF using a PDF viewer like Adobe Acrobat Reader or any other suitable application.

## Troubleshooting:
- **Doxygen Command Not Found**:
  - Ensure Doxygen is installed and added to your system's PATH.
  - Download Doxygen from [https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) if not already installed.
- **LaTeX Make Errors**:
  - Ensure a LaTeX distribution is installed and properly set up.
  - Check the `make` command output for details on missing dependencies.
